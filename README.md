# The Great Sacrifice Dueling Game
### Inspired by the game Hearthstone
The Great Sacrifice is a text-based turn by turn dueling card game. Simply, it is a two player game where each player draws cards and then selects the ones they willplay each turn. This card duel battle system is inspired by the game Hearthstone. Two players choose cards and use them strategically to inflict damage to their opponents. There is a bit of luck involved in getting cards from the deck, but overall it requires a significant amount of strategy from the player. Each player will start with a deck filled with 20 cards. Players will have the same cards in their deck as the other player, but the decks will be in a randomized order. Each player will start with 15 health, and 5 cards in their hand at the beginning of the match. There are 3 different classes of cards: attack, defend, and heal. Every turn a player chooses the 2 cards they will use. A player will draw 3 cards after their turn. After each player selects their cards they enter the battle stage. Attack card deals to the enemy player. Heal card’s will heal the player. Defend cards neutralize all damage regardless of how many attack cards the enemy used. Psychological warfare between players, who are going to use attack and defense cards. Players who run out of defense cards first are at greater risk of losing the game. As the battle progresses the amount of cards a player has in their hand will continually increase. If the cards run out before any player’s health reaches zero, the player's health will lose 1 health per round. As if a defender type was on the playing field. You are not able to attack player health. If a health type card is on the playing field. Their player health increases by one per card per start of their turn.
